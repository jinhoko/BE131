.SH SYNOPSIS
.B RNALfold
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
RNALfold 2.4.8
.PP
calculate locally stable secondary structures of RNAs
.PP
Compute locally stable RNA secondary structure with a maximal base pair span.
For a sequence of length n and a base pair span of L the algorithm uses only
O(n+L*L) memory and O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is practical to "scan" very
large genomes for short RNA structures.
Output consists of a list of secondary structure components of size <= L, one
entry per line. Each output line contains the predicted local structure its
energy in kcal/mol and the starting position of the local structure.

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-span\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Set the maximum allowed separation of a base
pair to span. I.e. no pairs (i,j) with
j\-i>span will be allowed.
.IP
(default=`150')
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitude nucleotide
"T" with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-outfile[=\fR<filename>]
Print output to file instead of stdout
.IP
This option may be used to write all output to output files rather than
printing to stdout. The default filename is "RNALfold_output.lfold" if no
FASTA header precedes the input sequences and the \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR feature is
inactive. Otherwise, output files with the scheme "prefix.lfold" are
generated, where the "prefix" is taken from the sequence id. The user may
specify a single output file name for all data generated from the input by
supplying an optional string as argument to this parameter. In case a file
with the same filename already exists, any output of the program will be
appended to it. Note: Any special characters in the filename will be replaced
by the filename delimiter, hence there is no way to pass an entire directory
path through this option yet. (See also the "\-\-filename\-delim" parameter)
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-infile=\fR<filename>
Read a file instead of reading from stdin
.IP
The default behavior of RNALfold is to read input from stdin. Using this
parameter the user can specify an input file name where data is read from.
.TP
\fB\-\-auto\-id\fR
Automatically generate an ID for each sequence.
(default=off)
.IP
The default mode of RNALfold is to automatically determine an ID from the
input sequence data if the input file format allows to do that. Sequence IDs
are usually given in the FASTA header of input sequences. If this flag is
active, RNALfold ignores any IDs retrieved from the input and automatically
generates an ID for each sequence. This ID consists of a prefix and an
increasing number. This flag can also be used to add a FASTA header to the
output even if the input has none.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-prefix\fR=\fI\,prefix\/\fR
Prefix for automatically generated IDs (as used
in output file names)
.IP
(default=`sequence')
.IP
If this parameter is set, each sequence will be prefixed with the provided
string. Hence, the output files will obey the following naming scheme:
"prefix_xxxx.lfold" where xxxx is the sequence number. Note: Setting this
parameter implies \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-delim\fR=\fI\,delimiter\/\fR
Change the delimiter between prefix and
increasing number for automatically generated
IDs (as used in output file names)
.IP
(default=`_')
.IP
This parameter can be used to change the default delimiter "_" between
.IP
the prefix string and the increasing number for automatically generated ID.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-digits\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Specify the number of digits of the counter in
automatically generated alignment IDs.
.IP
(default=`4')
.IP
When alignments IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, starting with 1. This number will always be left\-padded by leading
zeros, such that the number takes up a certain width. Using this parameter,
the width can be specified to the users need. We allow numbers in the range
[1:18]. This option implies \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-start\fR=\fI\,LONG\/\fR
Specify the first number in automatically
generated alignment IDs.
.IP
(default=`1')
.IP
When sequence IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, usually starting with 1. Using this parameter, the first number can
be specified to the users requirements. Note: negative numbers are not
allowed.
Note: Setting this parameter implies to ignore any IDs retrieved from the
input data, i.e. it activates the \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR flag.
.TP
\fB\-\-filename\-delim\fR=\fI\,delimiter\/\fR
Change the delimiting character that is used
.IP
for sanitized filenames
.IP
(default=`ID\-delimiter')
.IP
This parameter can be used to change the delimiting character used while
sanitizing filenames, i.e. replacing invalid characters. Note, that the
default delimiter ALWAYS is the first character of the "ID delimiter" as
supplied through the \fB\-\-id\-delim\fR option. If the delimiter is a whitespace
character or empty, invalid characters will be simply removed rather than
substituted. Currently, we regard the following characters as illegal for use
in filenames: backslash '\e', slash '/', question mark '?', percent sign '%',
asterisk '*', colon ':', pipe symbol '|', double quote '"', triangular
brackets '<' and '>'.
.TP
\fB\-\-filename\-full\fR
Use full FASTA header to create filenames
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
This parameter can be used to deactivate the default behavior of limiting
output filenames to the first word of the sequence ID. Consider the following
example: An input with FASTA header ">NM_0001 Homo Sapiens some gene"
usually produces output files with the prefix "NM_0001" without the
additional data available in the FASTA header, e.g. "NM_0001.lfold". With
this flag set, no truncation of the output filenames is performed, i.e.
output filenames receive the full FASTA header data as prefixes. Note,
however, that invalid characters (such as whitespace) will be substituted by
a delimiting character or simply removed, (see also the parameter option
\fB\-\-filename\-delim\fR).
.TP
\fB\-\-commands=\fR<filename>
Read additional commands from file
.IP
Commands include hard and soft constraints, but also structure motifs in
hairpin and interior loops that need to be treeted differently. Furthermore,
commands can be set for unstructured and structured domains.
.TP
\fB\-\-shape=\fR<filename>
Use SHAPE reactivity data in the folding
recursions (does not work for Zuker
suboptimals and stochastic backtracking yet)
.TP
\fB\-\-shapeMethod\fR=\fI\,[D\/\fR/Z/W] + [optional parameters]
Specify the method how to convert SHAPE
.TP
reactivity data to pseudo energy
contributions
.IP
(default=`D')
.IP
The following methods can be used to convert SHAPE reactivities into pseudo
energy contributions.
.IP
\&'D': Convert by using a linear equation according to Deigan et al 2009. The
calculated pseudo energies will be applied for every nucleotide involved in a
stacked pair. This method is recognized by a capital 'D' in the provided
parameter, i.e.: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"D" is the default setting. The slope 'm'
and the intercept 'b' can be set to a non\-default value if necessary,
otherwise m=1.8 and b=\-0.6. To alter these parameters, e.g. m=1.9 and b=\-0.7,
use a parameter string like this: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9b\-0.7". You may also
provide only one of the two parameters like: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9" or
\fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Db\-0.7".
.IP
\&'Z': Convert SHAPE reactivities to pseudo energies according to Zarringhalam
et al 2012. SHAPE reactivities will be converted to pairing probabilities by
using linear mapping. Aberration from the observed pairing probabilities will
be penalized during the folding recursion. The magnitude of the penalties can
affected by adjusting the factor beta (e.g. \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Zb0.8").
.IP
\&'W': Apply a given vector of perturbation energies to unpaired nucleotides
according to Washietl et al 2012. Perturbation vectors can be calculated by
using RNApvmin.
.TP
\fB\-\-shapeConversion\fR=\fI\,M\/\fR/C/S/L/O
+ [optional parameters]
Specify the method used to convert SHAPE
.TP
reactivities to pairing probabilities when
using the SHAPE approach of Zarringhalam et
al.
.IP
(default=`O')
.IP
The following methods can be used to convert SHAPE reactivities into the
probability for a certain nucleotide to be unpaired.
.IP
\&'M': Use linear mapping according to Zarringhalam et al.
\&'C': Use a cutoff\-approach to divide into paired and unpaired nucleotides
(e.g. "C0.25")
\&'S': Skip the normalizing step since the input data already represents
probabilities for being unpaired rather than raw reactivity values
\&'L': Use a linear model to convert the reactivity into a probability for
being unpaired (e.g. "Ls0.68i0.2" to use a slope of 0.68 and an intercept
of 0.2)
\&'O': Use a linear model to convert the log of the reactivity into a
probability for being unpaired (e.g. "Os1.6i\-2.29" to use a slope of 1.6
and an intercept of \fB\-2\fR.29)
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.
The Minimum free energy (MFE) and a structure representative are calculated
in any case.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zscore\fR[=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR]
Activate z\-score computation. An optional
argument may be supplied to set the threshold
Due to parsing the commandline parameters a
negative value should be given immediately
after "z" without spaces e.g. \fB\-z\-4\fR.9
.IP
(default=`\-2')
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gquad\fR
Incoorporate G\-Quadruplex formation into the
structure prediction algorithm
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins. Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for
bases adjacent to helices in free ends and
multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end.
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for mfe
and partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe
folding.
.IP
Note that with \fB\-d1\fR and \fB\-d3\fR only the MFE computations will be using this
setting while partition function uses \fB\-d2\fR setting, i.e. dangling ends will be
treated differently.
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs
(helices of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fI\,paramfile\/\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNALfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC
(\fB\-e\fR 1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
